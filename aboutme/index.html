<h2>Mark Riley Slik</h2>
<H2>Just call me Riley</H2>
<P>I am a CIT student at BYUI and I am married to my wonderful wife who also goes to BYUI. I am hoping to become a network Admin one day but my wife is wanting to go into web design. BYUI is a pretty friendly place to be which is one the things I like best about it.</P>
<p>Some of my hobby are painting and games, and those games range from video game to card games  to ttrpg I play a little bit of everything.</p>
